# Some pointers to historical development of CallHome #

I gave a 10 min talk at Sydney GTUG on the question of how to do responsive web apps on GAE without polling ([Options for Responsive GAE Applications](http://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dg7nkx7d_315dwf8dsdp)). I suggested we needed a new service and later wrote this doc describing it: [Responsive AJAX](http://docs.google.com/View?id=dg7nkx7d_3239mc4rs4g).

The current implementation is a modified version of the interim solution.
